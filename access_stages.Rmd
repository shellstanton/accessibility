### List tasks:

* Setup
* Download/install packages

* Install rgee package (not avaliable from CRAN so download from GitHub)
* Connect to GEE using rgee
* Initialise rgee package

* Define area of interest (aoi) using WGS84 coordinates
* Create area of interest polygon

* Read in LandSat 8 (LS8) Tier 1 data (not sure how data was accessed?)
* Filter LS8 data by aoi and by collection data

* Create a cloud mask
* Apply cloud mask to filtered LS8 data

* Calculate NVDI
* Calculate median NVDI p/pixel

* Clip to area of interest

* These data are saved as image within GEE
* Convert data to raster, which is saved as a .tif file in a temporary folder within either GDrive or GCS
* Store in local folder

* Download OpenStreetMap road data for aoi

* Calculate and assign speeds
  (NVDI pixels are calculated as walking speed)
  (Roads calculated by motor vehicle speeds)

* Merge NDVI and road rasters together to create friction surface raster

* Add in health facility locations

* Calculate transition matrix and cumulative cost
